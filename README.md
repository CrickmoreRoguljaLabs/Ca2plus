# Ca2plus
calcium imaging data analysis by Stephen Zhang

This package uses a PCA-ICA algorithm to semi-automatedly segment cells based on activity. It is modified from CellSort by Eran Mukamel (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19778505). Users should modify the cal2plus_settings.csv file before using, and run ca2plus after. It is recommended to run ca2plus section by section during the first use. The code also contains an autopilot mode that can be turned on in the ca2plus.m file to streamline processing (autopilot = 1).
